# INST377-Final-Project

# Name (Arvin Singh):

### Description of the Project
The background behind what this project is for is to help people see the current weather within a specific city of their choosing and based upon the current weather be able to tell whether or not they should consider leaving the house earlier or not.  many times within the modern world you're consistently seeing people being laid because of the lack of information that they have.  The idea behind this project is to give people that information in order for them to reach their desired destinations on time.  The project itself allows the users to get real-time weather data  by entering the name of a city and having the temperatures displayed as well as having the specific conditions that are going on within that City. 

The overall goal of the project is create a platform for users to be able to not only get to their desired destination on time but also see the weather conditions that may be affecting their time to their destination.  The hope of this project is to inform users on whether or not they should be leaving early based upon the weather conditions that are currently going on outside. 

### Description of target browsers
The target browsers of this application are  people who are consistently ahead and never on time because of certain weather-related issues that are always going on in life.  This application allows users to put in the city in which they live and the application will tell you based upon the weather whether or not they should be leaving the house early or leaving on time. 

 I would say this application is mostly targeted for any type of user whether it's iOS or Android or even people who just like to use a desktop. Anybody can use this application and it truly would be useful to everybody
